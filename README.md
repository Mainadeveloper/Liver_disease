 Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the presence of liver disease in patients based on clinical and demographic data. Using a logistic regression model, the system helps classify patients as either likely or unlikely to have liver disease, offering a useful tool for early detection.

✅ Project Summary
Dataset: A liver disease dataset containing patient records with features such as age, gender, bilirubin levels, liver enzyme levels, protein ratios, etc.
Model Used: Logistic Regression
Model Accuracy: Achieved ~76% accuracy on test data
Deployment: Trained model saved using pickle and ready for real-world prediction

 How It Works
Using features like:
Age
Gender
Total & Direct Bilirubin
Liver Enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)
Total Proteins, Albumin, Albumin-Globulin Ratio

…the model predicts whether a patient has liver disease (1) or not (0).
